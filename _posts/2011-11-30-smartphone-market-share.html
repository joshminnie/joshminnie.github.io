<p>For those of you looking for statistics that might help you determine which smartphones will be around long term, here are some links from <a title="Gartner Research" href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner Research</a> that should shed some light on whose really winning the &quot;smartphone war&quot;.</p>

<p>I'm definitely an iOS fan, but the most recent statistics are showing that Android seems to be coming out on top as far as consumers are concerned, with Microsoft's Windows Phone OS failing miserably.</p>
