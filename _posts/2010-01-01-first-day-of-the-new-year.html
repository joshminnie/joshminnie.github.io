<p>So today was the beginning of the New Year, 2010, and I have to say, I rather enjoyed the day off and the time with my family.</p>

<p>Today, I slept in and was awoken by my wife telling me that breakfast was ready at a very early 11am. After breakfast and beginning to get ready for our day, I realized it wasn't Saturday yet, and I get another whole day like this.</p>

<p>We made our way to the mall to buy me some new jeans (I was in desperate need of some, as the ones I had been wearing were wearing quite thin). We spent a few hours there, which went by so quickly, before we finally came home to just play with my son and give him some dinner before sending off to bed. I really love getting to spend time with my &quot;buddy&quot;.</p>

<p>After that, it was &quot;mom and dad&quot; time. We took advantage of that by spending a little time on the computers before having our favorite movie night dinner - chicken fingers. Yum!</p>

<p>I'm finally heading off to bed... and well, I get to do a day like this all over again tomorrow. I love my family.</p>
