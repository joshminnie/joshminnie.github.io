Everyone needs a "Hello World" post, so why should I be any different?

This is actually my first post after migrating to a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll") hosted site.
After only a few minutes getting my initial site published, I am already enjoying the freedom I have
unattached from a service like [WordPress](http://wordpress.org). Don't get me wrong, WordPress is a
great tool for publishing a blog, but a Jekyll powered site just seems to fit my workflow better.

### Why Jekyll?

I currently have a number of sites that I manage which are powered by WordPress, [Expression Engine](http://expressionengine.com)
or similar content management systems. On each one of them, when managing content, I would find myself
back in my text editor "finessing" the markup. So I decided to make the change to just go with a system
where I start in my text editor, and with Jekyll, I never leave my text editor (except to commit my changes
to my [Github](http://github.com) repo).
