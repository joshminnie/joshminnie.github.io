<p>Everyone needs a &quot;Hello World&quot; post, so why should I be any different?</p>

<p>Actually, this is my first post after migrating to a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" title="Jekyll" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> hosted site. After only a few minutes getting my initial site published, I am already enjoying the freedom I have unattached from a service like <a href="http://wordpress.org" title="WordPress" target="_blank">WordPress</a>. Don't get me wrong, WordPress is a great tool for publishing a blog, but a Jekyll powered site just seems to fit my workflow better.</p>

<h3>Why Jekyll?</h3>

<p>I currently have a number of sites that I manage which are powered by WordPress, <a href="http://expressionengine.com" title="Expression Engine" target="_blank">Expression Engine</a> or similar content management systems. On each one of them, when managing content, I would find myself back in my text editor &quot;finessing&quot; the markup. So I decided to make the change to just go with a system where I start in my text editor, and with Jekyll, I never leave my text editor (except to commit my changes to my <a href="http://github.com" title="Github" target="_blank">Github</a> repo).
