<p>Tonight my brother and I are hanging out (as we do every other Tuesday), except tonight is the last one of the year. I'm sure it will be good. We're going to eat some leftover Christmas turkey and watch a couple of movies (<a title="District 9" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1136608/" target="_blank">District 9</a> and <a title="Tropical Thunder" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0942385/" target="_blank">Tropical Thunder</a>). Because my brother is such an avid movie watcher, it's getting harder to find movies that he hasn't seen.  He's seen both movies and said that District 9 has good rewatch value, so hopefully he enjoys tonights' movie choices as well.</p>
