<p>I just read the article, <a href="http://developmentseed.org/blog/2013/06/25/healthcare-launches-in-the-open/" target="_blank">Launching HealthCare.gov</a> from the developers of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and was definitely impressed with the power that it has to support a site of that scale. Of course there is probably hardware to back up the site itself, but as a <abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr>, Jekyll can pull it's own weight.</p>

<p>There were a few plugins that they developed in order to support customized behavior, which if you're hosting a Jekyll site on <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a> then you won't be able to benefit from the use of plugins because Github runs in safe mode, but Jekyll was what is powering the site.</p>

<p>Since Jekyll really compliments my workflow very well, I've definitely become a huge proponent of what it can do. It's exciting to hear about large scale sites using Jekyll, or hearing the unique ways they were able to customize it.</p>
