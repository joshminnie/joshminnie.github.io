<p>So tonight was a busy night, I spent pretty much my entire night catching up on getting our finances in order. (Okay, I did manage to have some time playing Legos with my 11 month old and dinner with my family.)</p>

<p>It's amazing how difficult it is to keep track of everything when you use the credit/debit card instead of just cash, but it made things easier when we were shopping. (Don't tell Dave Ramsey I said that.) I had everything caught up two weeks before Christmas, but hadn't gotten a chance to enter data into Money until tonight. I didn't realize I was that far behind until I looked at the pile of credit card receipts from various merchants who were willing to help me lighten my wallet a little bit. In a way, it did kind of the opposite, because I had like 20 receipts (no exaggeration) in my wallet. That made for a pretty fat wallet and very uncomfortable to sit on.</p>

<p>Needless to say, my wallet is once again skinny and light, and I finally feel caught up on managing our personal finances.</p>

<p>Note to self: try not to get so far behind next time.</p>
